## Role

**Hybrid model** — Claude builds collaboratively with the owner (see the full
working agreement in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)).

- **Do** write and modify code (frontend, Rust, tests).
- **Do** propose a brief plan before non-trivial work; the owner decides who
  implements (they may claim parts they want to learn).
- **Do** read the current on-disk source before answering or reviewing — never
  rely on memory from earlier turns.
- **Do** edit documentation whenever it's helpful.

## Project Overview

**Owlerlay** is a Tauri-based **OBS overlay control center** for streamers
(countdowns today, more on the roadmap — see AGENTS.md). Built with:

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Frontend | Svelte 5, TypeScript (strict), Vite 7, PicoCSS |
| Backend | Rust (Edition 2024), Tauri 2 |
| Package manager | pnpm |

### Key paths

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/` | Svelte/TS frontend |
| `src-tauri/src/` | Rust Tauri commands & state |
| `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` | Tauri builder & command registration |
| `src-tauri/src/countdown/` | Countdown feature (commands, logic) |
| `src-tauri/src/app_state.rs` | Shared app state |
| `src-tauri/src/server/` | Axum overlay/SSE server + LAN remote API (`remote.rs`) |
| `src-tauri/src/settings.rs` | Persisted remote config + capability token |
| `src-tauri/src/remote.rs` | Phone-remote Tauri commands |
| `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` | Tauri configuration |

## Common Commands

```bash
pnpm install              # install JS deps
pnpm dev                  # Vite dev server (http://localhost:1420)
pnpm tauri dev            # full app in dev mode
pnpm build                # tsc + Vite build
pnpm tauri build          # desktop bundle
pnpm check                # svelte-check + tsc
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml   # Rust tests
```

---

## Coding Conventions (summary — see AGENTS.md for full details)

- **TypeScript**: 2-space indent, strict mode, `camelCase` vars/fns, `PascalCase` types.
- **Rust**: 4-space indent (`rustfmt`), `snake_case` fns/modules, Edition 2024.
- Tauri commands: keep small and side-effect focused; register in `lib.rs`.
- Commit style: Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.).

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
